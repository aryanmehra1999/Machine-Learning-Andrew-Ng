# Machine-Learning-Andrew-Ng-Assignment-Solutions
This is a repository that contains all the assignments and reference of the Andrew Ng course for Machine Learning available on Coursera.  
I strongly recommend not to copy these solutions but to read them as they have several comments by me that help in the understanding of several concepts and vectorisation techniques.
